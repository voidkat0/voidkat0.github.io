						<h3>Boxing</h3>
						<p>I've been boxing since the 8th grade. For the first few years I was studying abroad and had to practice under a professional trainer with men who practiced competively. When I came back to America
						I joined some local classes.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="homesi2">
						<h3>Chess & 5D Chess</h3>
						<p>I've been playing chess since middle school and learned many gambits and openers, however I like to mix my play style to use the logic of these well established moves without being very predictable when 
						playing against someone who has an algorithmic playstyle, as I think in most cases adding calculated unpredictability against players who rely on these algorithms is the best strategy. I also feel that 
						adaptibility and not relying very heavily on these algorithms myself keeps my skills sharp. However I could rarely find people to play against, so I started playing chess online, including 5D chess with
						multilinear timetravel (in which I am undefeated), which has recently become my favorite variant of chess because of the added challenge and need to keep track of so many variables</p>
					</div>
					<div class="homesi2">
						<h3>Billingual</h3>
						<p>I speak both English and Spanish fluently, having been born in America and being a native English speaker. I learned Spanish having grown up speaking it, and having studied abroad. I had to do all my schoolwork
						in spanish and taking language and literature classes in spanish for the majority of middle school. In addition to having been exposed to life in a Spanish speaking country, I also completed up to AP Spanish in
						highschool in order to garuntee my understanding of both the natural use of spanish and it's grammatical syntax.</p>

						<h3>HTML, CSS, and basic Javascript</h3>
						<p>I built this website in about 3 days</p>

						<h3>Avid Reader</h3>
						<p> I've read about 800 books, with exactly 186 books in my room alone, in addition to the many ebooks I've read, books I've given away, or had simply borrowed from the library. The genre of books
						that have captivated me vary significantly. Within fiction sci-fi classics like Ender's game, Dune, The Martian, and many H.G Wells stories have stuck with me, and dystopian novels such as 1984, and A clockwork
						orange have ingrained themselves into my mind. And while I've read many classic novels ranging from little women to the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy, I also enjoy newer experimental fiction,
						such as house of leaves. I also read non fiction, with books ranging from a textbook on marketing that my mom's friend lent me to the autobiography of Malcolm X. I've read a good mix of textbooks, 
						scientific articles, and anthroplogical bodies of work. Though few of these were physical books, and many were papers on social media algorithms or a recnet archeological discovery.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="homesi2">
						<h3>Puzzle and strategy games</h3>
						<p>I've always loved strategy board games, and recently I have especially loved brain bending puzzle games such as Portal. In my free time I prefer to play a strategy or puzzle game</p>
					</div>
					<div class="homesi2">
						<h3>Knitting and Crochet</h3>
						<p>Self taught in crochet and knitting, I've been crocheting for several years and recently taught myself how to knit. I am currently making a blanket with hyperbolic geometry. </p>
